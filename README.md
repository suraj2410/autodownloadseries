# autodownloadseries
Python script to automatically download exact Season and Episode number in Ubuntu 16

Uses <a href="http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html">Selenium Web driver </a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">gecko driver </a> for Firefox based interactions.

This script assumes that the first available search index from Google will have the required seasons but this might change according to the variations in HTML and the site structure.

Works for most of the part till now as and when tested!

Comments and suggestions are always welcome :)
